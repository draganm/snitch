# Snitch - report on things

A sort of cron with docker and web UI executor to run check regularly.

## TODO

* An executor that works
* Timeline view
* Last failure view
* Task deadline
* Task edition
* Record task status: exit status, last log line, run time
* External reporting?
* Task grouping?
